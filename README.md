# Task Management App made with React and Firebase


First time using Firebase for the backend and it is a blast ! Very efficient, fast and fun to learn.

Had a lot of fun doing this project.
For the next project I'm gonna use Authentication and File Storage with Firebase, so I can't wait to get started on that one.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
